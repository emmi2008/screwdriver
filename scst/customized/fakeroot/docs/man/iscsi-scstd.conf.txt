NAME
       /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf - configuration for iSCSI SCST Target Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/iscsi-scstd.conf contains configuration information for the iscsi-
       scstd (8) command. This is the place, where you	configure  your	 iSCSI
       targets and daemon parameters.

       Only  lines starting with ‘#’ are ignored. Putting ’#’ in the middle of
       a line is disallowed. A line may be extended across multiple  lines  by
       making the last character a backslash.

       The "Yes" and "No" for parameter values are case sensitive. The parame-
       ter names are case insensitive.

       The file consists of a global part and zero or more  "Target"  stanzas.
       Everything until the first target definition belongs to the global con-
       figuration.

       Here is an example:

       IncomingUser joe secret
       OutgoingUser jack secret2

       Target iqn.2007-05.com.example:storage.disk2.sys1.xyz
	   IncomingUser jim othersecret
	   OutgoingUser james yetanothersecret
	   Alias Test
	   HeaderDigest None
	   DataDigest None
	   MaxConnections 1
	   InitialR2T No
	   ImmediateData Yes
	   MaxRecvDataSegmentLength 1048576
	   MaxXmitDataSegmentLength 1048576
	   MaxBurstLength 1048576
	   FirstBurstLength 1048576
	   DefaultTime2Wait 2
	   DefaultTime2Retain 20
	   MaxOutstandingR2T 20
	   DataPDUInOrder Yes
	   DataSequenceInOrder Yes
	   ErrorRecoveryLevel 0

       Stanzas start with the word "Target" and the  target  name.  This  name
       must  be a globally unique name, as defined by the iSCSI standard : the
       "iSCSI Qualified Name". The daemon brings the targets up in  the	 order
       listed.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       Global Options are case sensitive.

       [IncomingUser <username> <password>]
	      The  <username> and <password> used during discovery sessions to
	      authenticate iSCSI initiators. Several of those can be specified
	      for discovery. If no IncomingUser is specified, any initiator is
	      allowed to open a discovery session.
	      HINT: RFC 3720 requires <password> to  be	 12  characters	 long.
	      This is enforced e.g. by MS Initiator.

       [OutgoingUser <username> <password>]
	      The  <username> and <password> used during discovery sessions to
	      authenticate the target to initiators. Only one outgoing	<user-
	      name>/<password> combination may be specified.
	      HINT:  RFC  3720	requires  <password> to be 12 characters long.
	      This is enforced e.g. by MS Initiator.

       Target iqn.<yyyy-mm>.<tld.domain.some.host>[:<identifier>]
	      A target definition and the target name. The targets  name  (the
	      iSCSI  Qualified	Name  )	 must  be  a  globally unique name (as
	      defined by the iSCSI standard) and has to start  with  iqn  fol-
	      lowed  by	 a  single  dot.  The  EUI-64  form  is not supported.
	      <yyyy-mm> is the date (year and month) at which  the  domain  is
	      valid.  This has to be followed by a single dot and the reversed
	      domain name.   The  optional  <identifier>  -  which  is	freely
	      selectable  - has to be separated by a single colon. For further
	      details please check the iSCSI spec.

	      Here is an example:

	      Target iqn.2007-05.com.example.host:storage.disk2.sys1.xyz

TARGET OPTIONS
       Target options are also case sensitive.

       [IncomingUser <username> <password>]
	      The <username> and <password> used  to  authenticate  the	 iSCSI
	      initiators to this target. It may be different from the username
	      and password in section GLOBAL OPTIONS, which is used  for  dis-
	      covery.  If  you	omit  the IncomingUser Option, connections are
	      allowed without authentication. A <password> has to be provided,
	      if  there	 is  a	<username> given. Specifying several different
	      IncomingUser accounts is supported.

       [OutgoingUser <username> <password>]
	      The <username> and <password> used to  authenticate  this	 iSCSI
	      target  to  initiators. Only one OutgoingUser per target is sup-
	      ported. It may be different from the username  and  password  in
	      section  GLOBAL  OPTIONS,	 which is used for discovery. A <pass-
	      word> has to be provided, if there is a <username> given.

       [Alias <aliasname>]
	      This assigns an optional <aliasname> to the target.

       [HeaderDigest <CRC32C|None>]
	      Optional. If set to "CRC32C" and	the  initiator	is  configured
	      accordingly,  the	 integrity  of	an iSCSI PDU’s header segments
	      will be protected by a CRC32C checksum. The default  is  "None".
	      Note that header digests are not supported during discovery ses-
	      sions.

       [DataDigest <CRC32C|None>]
	      Optional. If set to "CRC32C" and	the  initiator	is  configured
	      accordingly,  the	 integrity of an iSCSI PDU’s data segment will
	      be protected by a CRC32C checksum. The default is	 "None".  Note
	      that data digests are not supported during discovery sessions.

       [MaxConnections <value>]
	      Optional.	 The number of connections within a session. Has to be
	      set to "1" (in words: one), which is also the default since MC/S
	      is not supported.

       [InitialR2T <Yes|No>]
	      Optional.	 If  set  to  "Yes", the initiator has to wait for the
	      target to solicit SCSI data before sending  it.  Setting	it  to
	      "No"  (default)  allows  the initiator to send a burst of First-
	      BurstLength bytes unsolicited right after and/or	(depending  on
	      the  setting  of ImmediateData ) together with the command. Thus
	      setting it to "No" may improve performance.

       [ImmediateData <Yes|No>]
	      Optional. This allows the initiator to append  unsolicited  data
	      to  a command. To achieve better performance, this should be set
	      to "Yes". Which is the default.

       [MaxRecvDataSegmentLength <value>]
	      Optional. Sets the maximum  data	segment	 length	 that  can  be
	      received.	 The  <value> should be set to multiples of PAGE_SIZE.
	      Configuring too large values may	lead  to  problems  allocating
	      sufficient  memory, which in turn may lead to SCSI commands tim-
	      ing out at the initiator host. The default value is  the	highes
	      possible for current platform (1 or 2 MB).

       [MaxXmitDataSegmentLength <value>]
	      Optional. Sets the maximum data segment length that can be sent.
	      The <value> actually used	 is  the  minimum  of  MaxXmitDataSeg-
	      mentLength  and  the  MaxRecvDataSegmentLength  announced by the
	      initiator. The <value> should be set to multiples of  PAGE_SIZE.
	      Configuring  too	large  values  may lead to problems allocating
	      sufficient memory, which in turn may lead to SCSI commands  tim-
	      ing  out	at the initiator host. The default value is the highes
	      possible for current platform (1 or 2 MB).

       [MaxBurstLength <value>]
	      Optional. Sets the  maximum  amount  of  either  unsolicited  or
	      solicited	 data  the  initiator  may send in a single burst. Any
	      amount of data exceeding this value must be explicitly solicited
	      by  the  target.	The  <value>  should  be  set  to multiples of
	      PAGE_SIZE. Configuring too large values  may  lead  to  problems
	      allocating  sufficient  memory,  which  in turn may lead to SCSI
	      commands timing out at the initiator host. The default value  is
	      the highes possible for current platform (1 or 2 MB).

       [FirstBurstLength <value>]
	      Optional.	 Sets the amount of unsolicited data the initiator may
	      transmit in the first burst of a	transfer  either  with	and/or
	      right after the command, depending on the settings of InitialR2T
	      and  ImmediateData  <value>  should  be  set  to	multiples   of
	      PAGE_SIZE.  Configuring  too  large  values may lead to problems
	      allocating sufficient memory, which in turn  may	lead  to  SCSI
	      commands	timing out at the initiator host. The default value is
	      the highes possible for current platform (1 or 2 MB).

       [DefaultTime2Wait <value>]
	      Currently not supported.

       [DefaultTime2Retain <value>]
	      Currently not supported.

       [MaxOutstandingR2T <value>]
	      Optional. Controls the maximum number of data transfers the tar-
	      get may request at once, each of up to MaxBurstLength bytes. The
	      default is 20.

       [DataPDUInOrder <Yes|No>]
	      Optional. Has to be set to "Yes" - which is also the default.

       [DataSequenceInOrder <Yes|No>]
	      Optional. Has to be set to "Yes" - which is also the default.

       [ErrorRecoveryLevel <value>]
	      Optional. Has to be set to "0" (in words: zero), which  is  also
	      the default.

       [QueuedCommands <value>]
	      Optional. This parameter defines a window of commands an initia-
	      tor may send and that will be buffered by the target.  Depending
	      on  your hardware and your (expected) workload, the value may be
	      carefully adjusted. The default value of 32 should be sufficient
	      for most purposes.

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       Currently  (as  of  0.4.11)  not	 all iSCSI target parameters are used.
       Header and data digests are not supported during discovery sessions.
